# GitHub Copilot Status

(Note from Sam: although I'd like to take credit for this, ChatGPT 4 built the whole thing, lol.)

This extension adds a status bar item to show the current state of GitHub Copilot inline suggestions. Clicking on the status bar item will toggle the suggestions on and off.

## Features

- Displays the current state of GitHub Copilot inline suggestions in the status bar.
- Toggles GitHub Copilot inline suggestions by clicking on the status bar item.
